# MCTurtles
This was made to remember the complex systems that I made in the game
to help with creating rockets across the modded game pack I made.
Lua Code for Turtles in Mod MC, to re-supply resources

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized
I have utilized electrical wiring techniques,<br />
that are further expressed in programing<br /> 
<br /> 
Also Performed Block Programing with RFTools to manage,<br /> 
incompatible in-Game Storage systems.<br /> 
<br /> 
Had to draw diagrams for the redstone wiring diagrams<br /> 
that needed to perform the actions.<br /> 
<br />  
Shows that I can adapt to diffrent systems to accomplish a task<br /> 
that is needed with multiple systems.
